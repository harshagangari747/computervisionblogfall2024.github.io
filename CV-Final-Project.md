### Project Idea: 
Given two similar images, as input to the game 'Spot the differences', but with very small transformation of the objects in those images like difference in color, position or shape,
the objective is to detect the differences in those two images and then generate clue to the player about the region where those differences lies.
The clue may vaguely describes about the object or position in the image. For example, a typical clue can be like 'Check at top right corner of the image', 'Check for flowers'.

### Proposed Approach:
* The first step is similar image generation. We would like to query Dall-E or find publicly available images.
* The second step is to find the regions in both the image where they differ
* Third, feed one of the image to the YOLO model
* Fourth, check if the pixel co-ordinates from the step 2 fall in any one of the bounding boxes generated by the YOLO model
* Fifth, if the pixel co-ordinates falls in one of the bounding box, the identify the object and generate clue by either considering the position of the object in the image (top left, top right, center, bottom left, bottom right)

### Input and Output Data:
* Input are two similar images which are generated by Dall-E or by finding publicly availabe images
* Output is set of clues that help player to spot the differences

### Training data
* For this project, training data is not necessary as we are opting to use predefined models like DALL-E, YOLO.

### Evaluation plan
* Testing the Model with giving the images where we know all the differences and evalauting how relevant are the clues generated is useful for finding differences.
* We can validate manually by following the clues to spot the differences in the images.

### Impact
* Spotting differences can be useful in analyzing change in the scenes which vary over the period of time.
* If developed into a full-fledged game, this exercise can aid kids to improve the visual perception skills.

### Limitations and Challenges
* In this model the clues are generated by detecting the objects by YOLO at the difference in the pixel value region.So it mainly depends on the efficiency of YOLO's bounding boxes to identify the object and locate difference.
* It is limited to detect the objects in predefined class of YOLO  which it is trained on. If object is not detected by the YOLO then it fails to generate clue by spotting differences.
